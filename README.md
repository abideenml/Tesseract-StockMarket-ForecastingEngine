# Stock Market Analyzer

In this project, I have made a desktop application with Java. I have used concepts of Object Oriented Programming, JavaFX and Facebook Prophet. This application 
extracts stock market data from api and stores it in csv. Then this data is read by pandas and used by Facebook Prophet to train and forecast the future. This 
forecast is also store in csv and graphs are plotted with matplotlib to visualize the results. I have also made real time stock selling and buying available in
this project with the help of Alpaca api. All the trades can be viewed in the Portfolio panel. This application also helps users in buying and selling stocks by 
finding the average rate of increase or decrease over the last 30 days.
